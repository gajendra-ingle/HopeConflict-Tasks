    <!-- Our Placement -->
    <h2><mark>Our Placement</mark></h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp It is always our endeavour to keep our students abreast with the
      latest developments in industry and other organizations. With the need of
      current employability, it becomes essential to grow with the technology
      need and hence T&P Department arranges various workshops and training
      programs for the students for their better upliftment.
      <br />
      &nbsp At the same time, many students got various opportunities to get
      placed in well esteemed organisations not only in “on campus drives” but
      also in “off campus drives” and made our institute proud. Every year, the
      concept of the value education is by design added to the training sessions
      so as to improve the quality of education to the students. Training and
      Placement Department plays a vital role in students overall development as
      well as from the college perspective point of view.
